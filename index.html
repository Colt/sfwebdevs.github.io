She spent 2 years in high school testing insurance rating software (yawn) before moving to San Francisco to major in Sociology at the University of San Francisco. After a few years dabbling in other industries, Sara realized that software development was her true calling. She prefers to work with the full stack, and is quickly falling in love with robust javascript apps built with backbone. Her next goal is to improve her skills in javascript test frameworks. Testing is key! When not writing apps, Sara enjoys cooking and tries to spend as much time sewing as she does ripping out stitches. She also has an unreasonable love for period British dramas and has seen every film incarnation of Sense and Sensibility. She lives in Concord (which is definitely in the Bay Area!) with her husband, Zeph, and their two fluffy cats, Azrael and Jake.</p>

                  <p>During my stint at WDI, I gravitated towards creating practical web apps.  For the individual class projects I designed and built tools both for specialized use of existing web resources (Walktopus Google-map-based walk preview app), and for novel applications (Stitcherdoodle crochet and knitting project management app).  Prior to WDI I worked as an environmental engineering consultant and manager specializing in air quality.  I was responsible for scoping problems and identifying key questions; developing plans to address these questions; overseeing junior associates to complete analyses; and evaluating results.  I want to use my web app design and project management skills to develop tools that address diverse challenges in various sectors.</p>

That changed when I started GuitarDistrict.com where I quickly had to learn the many concepts of web design and development. This passion and intrigue led me to learn more on my own and to eventually enroll in General Assembly's WDI program. I look forward to the next challenge where my entrepreneurial background is merged with my love for coding.</p>

                  <img src="assets/images/profile_pics/smith.jpeg" align="left"> <p>One of the first things I did when I got my first computer in 2000 was get an account at Neopets.com and learn HTML and CSS. Over the course of a few years I lost sight of my passion and began to follow the prospects of big money and majored in Financial Mathematics in college. I held a plethora of Finance and Accounting internships while working full-time during those four years of hell. When I finally graduated I realized that I made an unsatisfying choice and wanted to pursue a career that would give me intrinsic happiness. I wanted to do something that was mentally stimulating and something that was magical. I snagged up a job after college, saved a few quarters and lint in my pocket, and moved from Boston to San Francisco in September 2013 to pursue Web Development.</p>
